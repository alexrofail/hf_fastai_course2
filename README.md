# hf_fastai_course2
A collection of notebooks and links to my blogs covering the second edition of huggingface_fastai (with blurr) course hosted by Wayde Gilliam and Sanyam Bhutani. \

This is a working collection of notebooks I either create while coding along from scratch with from the HF course, or download and break/fix things related to the course. 

Topics covered
- HuggingFace datasets library: largely focused on preprocessing.
- HuggingFace tokenizers: how to think about what tokenizers to use for a given task and how to train tokenizers for a new task (like creating on for Python code.)
- HuggingFace transformers.
